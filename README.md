# A collection of shell scripts

This is not a project, but more a collection of maybe
useful things I collected during the years.

    Some are from my blog: https://blog.techottis.ch/

I thought that gists cannot really be linked together,
so this will become the blog repo and its own collection.

    For example:

	https://blog.techottis.ch/2013/01/19/a-small-script-gplot-csh-quick-plotting-with-gnuplot/

	https://blog.techottis.ch/2013/05/01/a-small-script-taritdate-sh-tars-directories-with-dates/
	
	https://blog.techottis.ch/2016/10/15/backup-with-rsync-a-la-time-machine-a-proof/
	    
Soon more docs here.

# Programs
